Here are the key points:\n\nBari Weiss, writing for Tablet, urges people to recognize the ideological shift in American liberalism towards a new ideology that mixes postmodernism, identity politics, neo-Marxism, and other elements, which she and others call “Critical Social Justice” or “Wokeness.”\nCritical Social Justice, including Critical Race Theory and Postcolonial Theory, is argued to inherently generate anti-Semitic outcomes due to its fundamental principles and views on power, privilege, and identity.\nCritical Race Theory is said to view Jews, particularly Ashkenazi Jews, as “white” and therefore complicit in systemic racism, despite the complex history of Jewish oppression. This framework struggles to reconcile the historical victimhood of Jews with their perceived current “white privilege.”\nPostcolonial Theory views the state of Israel as a product of Western colonialism, inherently racist and oppressive towards Palestinians. This perspective aligns with broader anti-Zionist sentiments within Critical Social Justice circles.\nThe article argues that the ideologies of Critical Race Theory and Postcolonial Theory are not equipped to understand or address the nuances of Jewish identity and history, leading to a simplification and misrepresentation of Jewish experiences and contributing to modern anti-Semitism.\nThe rise of these ideologies within liberal and progressive spaces is causing concern among Jews who feel that their history, identity, and the legitimacy of Israel are being unfairly attacked under the guise of social justice.\nThe article concludes that Critical Social Justice has a “Jewish problem” because it cannot reconcile its ideological premises with the realities of Jewish history and identity, leading to outcomes that can be perceived as anti-Semitic.\n\nOverall, the article presents a critique of how Critical Social Justice theories, particularly Critical Race Theory and Postcolonial Theory, intersect with Jewish identity and the state of Israel, arguing that these frameworks contribute to a resurgence of anti-Semitism under a new guise.",

    "text": "https://newdiscourses.com/2020/09/first-amendment-case-freedom-from-woke-religion/\nGiven the comprehensive analysis provided, it’s clear that the ideology of Critical Social Justice (CSJ) exhibits many characteristics that align with the functional definition of religion as outlined by Ben Clements and supported by various legal precedents and scholarly arguments. CSJ addresses fundamental questions of human existence, prescribes a comprehensive belief system, and mandates duties of conscience that parallel those found in traditional religions. Despite its lack of a theistic foundation, CSJ’s focus on systemic power, liberation, and its own set of moral laws and practices positions it within a realm that could be considered religious under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\nThis recognition raises significant legal and societal implications, particularly concerning the Establishment Clause, which prohibits the endorsement of any religion by the state. If CSJ is recognized as a religion, its current penetration into public institutions, including education and government policies, could be challenged on constitutional grounds. This would necessitate a reevaluation of how CSJ principles are integrated into public life, ensuring they remain within the personal domain of belief rather than being enforced or promoted by state mechanisms.\nThe debate over whether CSJ constitutes a religion is not merely academic but has practical implications for maintaining the secular and pluralistic principles foundational to American society. Protecting individual conscience and preventing the establishment of any state religion, including ideologies that function similarly to traditional religions, is paramount. This analysis underscores the need for ongoing dialogue and legal scrutiny to navigate the complex interplay between belief systems, individual rights, and the role of the state in a diverse and evolving society.",

Genuine disagreement can only come from within a Critical Theory perspective.\nThe ideology also views association with those who hold systemic power and privilege as morally reprehensible, equating it with supporting racism, misogyny, and other forms of bigotry.\nAdherents often express feeling exhausted by the constant battle against systemic oppression, viewing invitations to debate as exploitative and reinforcing the dominance they fight against.\nThe article concludes that expecting Critical Social Justice advocates to value or engage in debate and dialogue is a fundamental misunderstanding of their ideology, which rejects the foundational principles of liberalism and aims to dismantle the entire system in favor of Critical Theory.",
