This document presents summaries of articles on James Lindsay's New Discourses website from 2019 through to the end of 2023.

The summaries were produced by GPT-4 based on the original articles. 

The system prompt used was:

> You are a fair and neutral commentator.

There is some inconsistency in the formatting of the summaries because each article was summarized in a separate call to GPT-4. Consistency might be improved by elaborating the article prompt.

The document was formatting using the Quarto system. See <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
