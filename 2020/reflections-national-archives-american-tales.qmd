- The author visited Washington, D.C., and toured the National Archives, seeing foundational U.S. documents.
- They observed the excitement of children learning about history and reflected on the significance of the documents as embodiments of liberal principles.
- The entrance to the National Archives has changed since the author's childhood, making the path to the foundational documents less direct.
- The David M. Rubenstein Exhibit, located near the new entrance, focuses on the evolution of rights and civil liberties for all Americans, highlighting the nation's ongoing struggle to fulfill its liberal promises.
- The exhibit includes imagery and stories that represent diverse aspects of American history, including efforts to expand rights to various groups.
- The author perceives a dual narrative within the exhibit: one that celebrates the liberal foundations and progress of the U.S., and another, more critical narrative that questions the inclusivity and success of these liberal ideals.
- The critical narrative, according to the author, emphasizes failures and exclusions in American history, potentially overshadowing achievements in expanding rights and freedoms.
- The author argues that understanding and rejecting the critical perspective allows for a more hopeful and proud appreciation of American history and its liberal experiment.
- They encourage visitors to the National Archives to view the exhibits with an open mind, seeking the positive story of progress and liberalism in American history.
