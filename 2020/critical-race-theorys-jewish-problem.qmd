The article discusses the complex relationship between Critical Race Theory (CRT), Critical Social Justice (CSJ), and perceptions of Jewish identity and the state of Israel, highlighting concerns of anti-Semitism within these frameworks. Here are the key points:

- Bari Weiss, writing for Tablet, urges people to recognize the ideological shift in American liberalism towards a new ideology that mixes postmodernism, identity politics, neo-Marxism, and other elements, which she and others call "Critical Social Justice" or "Wokeness."
- Critical Social Justice, including Critical Race Theory and Postcolonial Theory, is argued to inherently generate anti-Semitic outcomes due to its fundamental principles and views on power, privilege, and identity.
- Critical Race Theory is said to view Jews, particularly Ashkenazi Jews, as "white" and therefore complicit in systemic racism, despite the complex history of Jewish oppression. This framework struggles to reconcile the historical victimhood of Jews with their perceived current "white privilege."
- Postcolonial Theory views the state of Israel as a product of Western colonialism, inherently racist and oppressive towards Palestinians. This perspective aligns with broader anti-Zionist sentiments within Critical Social Justice circles.
- The article argues that the ideologies of Critical Race Theory and Postcolonial Theory are not equipped to understand or address the nuances of Jewish identity and history, leading to a simplification and misrepresentation of Jewish experiences and contributing to modern anti-Semitism.
- The rise of these ideologies within liberal and progressive spaces is causing concern among Jews who feel that their history, identity, and the legitimacy of Israel are being unfairly attacked under the guise of social justice.
- The article concludes that Critical Social Justice has a "Jewish problem" because it cannot reconcile its ideological premises with the realities of Jewish history and identity, leading to outcomes that can be perceived as anti-Semitic.

Overall, the article presents a critique of how Critical Social Justice theories, particularly Critical Race Theory and Postcolonial Theory, intersect with Jewish identity and the state of Israel, arguing that these frameworks contribute to a resurgence of anti-Semitism under a new guise.
