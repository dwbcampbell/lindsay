title: The Defence Approach to Diversity
---
<https://newdiscourses.com/2020/06/defence-approach-diversity/>

- Andrew Fox critiques Surgeon Lieutenant Commander Mike Hill's article on diversity in Defence, arguing against the prioritization of diversity based on protected characteristics.
- Fox challenges Hill's assertion that diversity unequivocally benefits Defence, citing studies that question the positive impact of diversity on performance.
- The article emphasizes the distinction between diversity of thought and diversity based on protected characteristics, arguing the former is more beneficial.
- Fox points out the lack of military-specific research on diversity and highlights studies where diversity had negative impacts under certain conditions.
- The article critiques the Equalities Act 2010 for promoting superficial diversity, which may create divisions rather than unity.
- Fox advocates for neuro-diversity and diverse perspectives over demographic diversity, suggesting this approach can offer fresh solutions to complex problems.
- The conclusion calls for a reevaluation of Defence's diversity strategy to focus on fostering diverse thinking rather than meeting diversity targets based on protected characteristics.
