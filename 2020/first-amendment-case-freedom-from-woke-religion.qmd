abstract: The question of whether or not the worldview and practice—for practice it
  intentionally is—going variously by the names “Social Justice,” “Critical Social
  Justice,” or, more colloquially, “Woke” constitutes a religion is one of some general
  interest that seems to be growing.

Given the comprehensive analysis provided, it's clear that the ideology of Critical Social Justice (CSJ) exhibits many characteristics that align with the functional definition of religion as outlined by Ben Clements and supported by various legal precedents and scholarly arguments. CSJ addresses fundamental questions of human existence, prescribes a comprehensive belief system, and mandates duties of conscience that parallel those found in traditional religions. Despite its lack of a theistic foundation, CSJ's focus on systemic power, liberation, and its own set of moral laws and practices positions it within a realm that could be considered religious under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

This recognition raises significant legal and societal implications, particularly concerning the Establishment Clause, which prohibits the endorsement of any religion by the state. If CSJ is recognized as a religion, its current penetration into public institutions, including education and government policies, could be challenged on constitutional grounds. This would necessitate a reevaluation of how CSJ principles are integrated into public life, ensuring they remain within the personal domain of belief rather than being enforced or promoted by state mechanisms.

The debate over whether CSJ constitutes a religion is not merely academic but has practical implications for maintaining the secular and pluralistic principles foundational to American society. Protecting individual conscience and preventing the establishment of any state religion, including ideologies that function similarly to traditional religions, is paramount. This analysis underscores the need for ongoing dialogue and legal scrutiny to navigate the complex interplay between belief systems, individual rights, and the role of the state in a diverse and evolving society.
